# Front-End Learning Process Collection

Welcome to **Front-End Learning Collection** — a curated set of projects and exercises that document my journey through the world of front-end development.  

This repository exists for one purpose: to **record, structure, and showcase** (that started in 02-2025) my learning process, **Iaiakedemy** — from my very first HTML tags to advanced React concepts.

## 💡 Perspective

Learning front-end is like building an island —  
HTML is the foundation, CSS is the forms and colors, JavaScript makes it alive, React adds efficiency, Context API brings order, and Jest ensures everything works as planned.

This repository is my **island under construction**.

## 📚 About This Repository

This is not just a code dump.  
It’s a **modular learning archive** — each topic is organized into its own dedicated module, separated by **subject** and **level** (basic, intermediate, advanced).  

Here’s the full scope of what’s inside:

- **HTML** — from basic tags and structure to advanced semantics and accessibility.
- **CSS** — from simple styling to advanced layouts, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** — from syntax basics to advanced logic, DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and ESNext features.
- **React** — from component fundamentals to advanced patterns, hooks, and performance optimizations.
- **Context API** — for global state management without external libraries.
- **Testing with Jest** — from basic test cases to advanced testing strategies.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository’s **only mission** is to **document and track my growth** as a front-end developer.  
Every folder, commit, and file represents **a step forward** in my skills — a learning log I can look back on and see how far I’ve come.

Think of it as my personal “front-end evolution timeline”.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Navigate through the folders by subject.
2. Open the difficulty level you want to explore.
3. Check the code, comments, and notes to see the progression.
4. Learn, adapt, and build your own if you wish.

## 📌 Notes

- This is a **learning repository** — some early code may be messy on purpose (growth is a process!).
- All examples are crafted by me during my study sessions.
